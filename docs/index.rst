======================================

[beta version]

This project provides essential Financial, Planning & Analysis functions in Python.  It allows collecting data from Excel sheets and combining them into a multidimensional dataframe for easy slicing and dicing large amounts of data. The goal is to make an easier introduction into Python for analysts in corporate FP&A, accounting, investment banking, hedge fund and private equity.  

**pyfpa** leverages python's speed and power to address the challenges FP&A such as being able to keep all the verions of your data in one place, handling large data and data structures that are getting to big for excel (including consolidation and variance analysis), and not worrying about Excel link stability.
